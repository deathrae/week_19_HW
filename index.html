          <h4>Recordz App</h4>
          <p>We were motivated to create a record app because all three of us on the team enjoyed vinyl music. We conducted our research by looking at different competitors and conducted interviews with potential users. The main thing that influenced our decisions during this project was time restraints, as well as making the user feel supported. This project really solidified the design process for all of us.</p>

          <h4>Government Agency Web Redesign</h4>
          <p>My motivation behind the government agency web redesign was my love for education. I believe knowledge is power, and I also had a lot of ideas for the UI elements of this project from the beginning.  I conducted research by outlining the existing page, and trying to find broken links and errors in their design.</p>

          <h4>Non-Profit Redesign</h4>
          <p>Our motivation behind this project was working with stakeholders. Unfortunately we weren't able to work with stakeholders for this project. When we were at a pivotal moment for the project, we were able to have open and honest conversations about the pros and cons of each situation, and ultimately ended up with a beautiful redesign.</p>
